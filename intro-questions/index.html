            <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
            <p>1. My name is Tiffany Lee, and I am a junior majoring in Biology (premed).</p>
            <p>2. I am double minoring in studio and design in SamFox, and this class seemed interesting and a fun elective to take for my design minor.</p>
            <p>3. I have no experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
            <p>4. I want to learn how websites are created from the coding standpoint.</p>
            <p>5. Designing for a website is a lot more interactive than designing for paper. There are different sublinks and scrolling for websites.</p>
            <p>6. The Netflix page has a good design as it is very easy to search/find things, and it's put into categories. This is the best streaming platform that I've seen.</p>
            <p>7. The Outlook website has a effective communication as it is easy to navigate, and it communicates its exact purpose effectively.</p>
            <p>8. The notion website works well as it is very customizable and easy to personalize. It's a very good way to have an online planner and keep track of things.</p>
