        <h3>color term hierarchy</h3>
            <p>In the classic study of Brent Berlin and Paul Kay (1969), Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution,[2] the researchers argued that the differences in number of basic color terms in languages follow a repeatable pattern. Color terms can be organized into a coherent hierarchy and there are a limited number of universal basic color terms which begin to be used by individual cultures in a relatively fixed order. This order is defined in stages I-VII. Berlin and Kay originally based their analysis on a comparison of color words in 20 languages from around the world. The model is presented below, broken into stages, with stage I on the left and stage VII on the right</p>

                            <img src="..//images/stage 1 (dark-cool).png" id="onetwoimg">
                    </div> 
                        <p>Stage I contains two terms, <b><u>white</u></b> and <b><u>black</u></b> (light and dark); these terms are referenced broadly to describe other undefined color terms. For example, the Jale highland group in New Guinea identify the color of blood as black. This is because blood, as a relatively dark liquid, is grouped into the same color classification as black.
                        In the Bassa language, there are two terms for classifying colors; ziza (white, yellow, orange and red) and hui (black, violet, blue, and green).
                        In the Pirahã language, there appear to be no color terms beyond describing lightness and darkness.
                        The Dani language of western New Guinea differentiates only two basic colors: mili for cool/dark shades such as blue, green, and black; and mola for warm/light colors such as red, yellow, and white</p>

                <div class="twogrid">
                <img src="..//images/stage 2.png" id="twoimg">
                <p>Stage II implements a third term for <b><u>red</u></b>. Objects begin to rely less on their brightness for classification and in this stage we instead see each term cover a larger scope of colors. Specifically, blue and other darker shades continue to be described as black, yellow and orange colors are classified with red, and other bright colors continue to be classified with white.
                In the Bambara language, there are three color terms: dyema (white, beige), blema (reddish, brownish) and fima (dark green, indigo and black).</p>

        <div class="stage-threeandfour">
            <h3>stage 3/4 (yellow + green)</h3>
                <div class="threegrid">
                <div class="threeimg">
                    <img src="..//images/stage 3.1.png" id="threeoneimg">

                </div>
                <p>Stage III identifies a third term referring either to <b><u>green (IIIa)</u></b> or <b><u>yellow (IIIb)</u></b>. Most languages in the study with this system identify yellow over green, such as the Komi language, where green is considered a shade of yellow (виж, vizh), called турун виж (turun vizh): 'grass yellow'.[9] However, the Nigerian Ibibio language and the Philippine Hanunoo language both identify green instead of yellow.
                The Ova-Himba use four color names: zuzu stands for dark shades of blue, red, green, and purple; vapa is white and some shades of yellow; buru is some shades of green and blue; and dambu is some other shades of green, red, and brown.[10] It is thought that this may increase the time it takes for the Ova-Himba to distinguish between two colors that fall under the same Herero color category, compared to people whose language separates the colors into two different color categories.</p>

                <div class="fourgrid">
                <p>Stage IV incorporates <b><u>green</u></b> or <b><u>yellow</u></b>, which ever was not already present, i.e. stage IIIa languages will adopt yellow and stage IIIb languages will adopt green. Most stage IV languages continue to colexify blue and green, as listed in Blue–green distinction in language.
                The Chinese character 青 (pronounced qīng in Mandarin and ao in Japanese) has a meaning that covers both blue and green. In more contemporary terms, they are 藍 (lán, in Mandarin) and 綠 (lǜ, in Mandarin) respectively. Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green, 緑 (midori, derived from the classical Japanese descriptive verb midoru 'to be in leaf, to flourish' in reference to trees) and グリーン (guriin, which is derived from the English word 'green').</p>

                <p>The seventh basic color term is likely to be <b><u>brown</u></b>.
                    In English, this is the first basic color term (other than black and white) that is not differentiated on hue, but rather on lightness. English splits some hues into several distinct colors according to lightness: such as red and pink or orange and brown. To English speakers, these pairs of colors, which are objectively no more different from one another than light green and dark green, are conceived of as belonging to different categories</p>

                <p>Stage VII adds additional terms for <b><u>orange</u></b>, <b><u>pink</u></b>, <b><u>purple</u></b> or <b><u>grey</u></b>, but these do not exhibit the same hierarchy as the previous seven colors.
                English contains eleven basic color terms: 'black', 'white', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'brown', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', and 'grey'.</p>
